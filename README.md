# fantasy-football-projector

To run this program, clone the repository and run main.java.

This Java project predicts the outcome of my 2019 Fantasy Football league. The system works by taking input data (which can be found in the 'Resources' directory) for each of the 16 teams.  The data consists of each player's position, bye week, average points scored until week 11, and standard deviation of points scored until week 11. 

The program takes this data and then runs an X amount of seasons and finds the percentage of times each team makes the playoffs, makes it to the championship, wins the championship, etc. Teams with players that have averaged more points and have a small standard deviation obviously have a better chance of winning.
